## About The Project:

Todolist is a popular task manager and toâ€“do list application. In this application you can create and delete todo-lists,
change their name, create, delete, modify and sort tasks in them. Registration is also implemented in the project. In
this application,I also used a storybook, that allows me to develop components in isolation, which improves testability
and speed of development. I have also additionally written unit tests.
